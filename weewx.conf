#   This service acts as a filter, converting the unit system coming from

[StdConvert]
    
    # The target_unit affects only the unit system in the database. Once
    # chosen it cannot be changed without converting the entire database.
    # Modification of target_unit after starting weewx will result in
    # corrupt data - the database will contain a mix of US and METRIC data.
    #
    # The value of target_unit does not affect the unit system for
    # reporting - reports can display US, Metric, or any combination of units.
    #
    # In most cases, target_unit should be left as the default: US
    #
    # In particular, those migrating from a standard wview installation
    # should use US since that is what the wview database contains.
